# Sustainable_investment_classificator

The work consists of the creation of a classifier that is able to understand if the sustainable investment in a given country is good or not, we are going to verify if actually, the results obtained with our tool match real-life data. We will also try to find possible groups within our observations to analyze the phenomenon in detail.
